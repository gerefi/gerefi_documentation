# So what are the limitations?

While we try to be as helpful as possible there are a some things we just cannot do, this page attempts to outline them and explain a little of why it is not possible.

## Custom hardware

We get a lot of questions along the lines of "Can gerEFI run on XYZ processor?" or "Can gerEFI use XYZ chip in its circuits?" the current status of the gerEFI project means that there is little time for

## Custom code support

## Individual component/vehicle help

## Installation

## STM32 Chips

There are many possible STM32 chips and development boards available on Ebay and Aliexpress that might in theory work with gerEFI.  
In reality there is absolutely no guarantee that any one of these will work as there are so many small variations of pinout, ram spec, processor speed, IO configurations, etc that it is impossible to support them all.  
This is without considering the problems that come with fake/poor quality chips or the GD32 series.  
For these reasons gerEFI only officially supports some stm32f4/f7 chips we cannot provide assistance to get gerEFI working on any other chip set.
