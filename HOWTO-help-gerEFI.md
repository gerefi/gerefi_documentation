# How can I help gerEFI?

The weakest point of gerEFI is lack of samples and success stories. As of Aug 2020, we _really_ need vehicle threads on the forum.

We also do not have much user feedback in general - we do not know how many gerEFI units are used regularly and what are users looking for (we know about launch control).

Another weak point of gerEFI is documentation. If you've played with gerEFI for any time chances are you have help [improve the documentation.](HOWTO-contribute-to-documentation)

We are also extremely short on software developers. [HOWTO contribute to firmware](HOWTO-contribute-to-firmware)

## Please do good and do not do bad

We hope that as a community we can leverage each other's skills and have peaceful fun together.

A: How can you help? There are so many ways to help, quite often having a test mule and being available to try new features is huge help!

## Last but not least

Test PCBs, forum hosting, damaged hardware and etc. costs money

There are two ways to help financially:
