# HOWTO Upload Log

## Data Rate

Licensed TunerStudio would you give you faster data rate which is *very* important while troubleshooting trigger/vvt issues. Go "Communications->Data Rate->Max Rate Per Second". We pride for having above 500Hz data rate via USB! See [Logging Guide](Logging-Guide) for more info.

Slower rate is recommended for running fuel control troubleshooting, higher rate logs are needed for cranking/trigger troubleshooting. Logs below 100Hz are totally useless for trigger troubleshooting
