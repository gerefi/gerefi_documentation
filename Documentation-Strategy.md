# Documentation Strategy

Open question: What is in scope of gerEFI wiki and what is out of scope?

* A of Nov 2022 the best cost/benefit ratio is to work on TunerStudio layout and TunerStudio field tooltips and help articles which are embedded into "Help" of specific dialogs.
* Bruno does not believe in text documentation on wiki
* Content problem versus infrastructure/structure problem like <https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi_documentation/issues/250> and <https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi_documentation/issues/168>
* We are probably not trying to teach people how to tune HP Academy does that better

## Wiki status

As of December, 2022 the strategy is to maintain two wikis, with [the same source](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi_documentation) for both.
[https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/wiki/](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/wiki/) AKA Wiki2
[https://wiki.gerefi.com](https://wiki.gerefi.com) AKA Wiki3

Reasons for using a source repo:

1. Access control
2. Change review process
3. History and version control management

Problems with Github Wiki:

1. [Not crawlable by search engines](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1683)

Problems with having two wikis:

1. Inconsistency of markup language between the two wikis
