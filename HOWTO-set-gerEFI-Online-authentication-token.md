# HOWTO Set gerEFI Online Authentication Token

In order for your gerEFI console to upload your tune to gerEFI online you will need to configure gerEFI console authentication token.

Please open your gerEFI Forum profile, ["Your Vehicles" tab](https://gerefi.com/forum/ucp.php?i=254) - and you will fix the auth token value there. Copy it from the forum profile into gerEFI console settings - and now your local console can upload to the website!

Do not share your authentication token - it yours and yours only, that's how to system establishes the tune owner.
