Hello and welcome!

You have found the gerEFI wiki main page. Here you will find information related to gerEFI, a GPL open-source engine control unit for gasoline port-injected internal combustion engines. This project involves embedded hardware, software, and engines (vroom vroom). This community has many members from many walks of life who are scattered all around the world.

**This project is NOT for emissions controlled or safety critical applications. This project is for race cars, snow blowers, fixed engine applications, and science experiments. It is PROHIBITED to use gerEFI on manned aircraft.**

In order to use gerEFI you will need to acquire or fabricate one of the [supported boards](Hardware). You can also design your own custom board if so desired.

You can use gerEFI PC simulator to try gerEFI. PC simulator Windows binaries are included into [gerEFI Bundle](Download), and the Unix version of PC simulator could be compiled from [source code](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/tree/master/simulator).

## Get Started

So you are thinking of doing an engine control project. You have stopped by the correct place. This gerEFI project has many options that can likely help you out. We have several forum members with a wide variety of skills that are often willing to help people out. As well we have several hardware options. If a feature doesn't exist inquire in the forums and it is likely that we can develop the feature. Or better yet, its an open source project, you can develop it yourself and if you feel like giving something back, you can share it with others.
