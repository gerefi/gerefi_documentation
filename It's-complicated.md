# Open Source? It's Complicated

gerEFI [_firmware_](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi) is completely open source software see [license](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/blob/master/firmware/license.txt).

Many of the **universal** gerEFI [boards](Hardware) are open source hardware.

As of Jan of 2022 gerEFI LLC is experimenting with vehicle-specific boards being proprietary, not open source hardware. while [Hellen One framework](https://github.com/BrunoFA-git/hellen-one) is open source, only [Hellen 121 VAG](https://github.com/gerefi/hellen121vag) and [Helen 154 Hyundai](https://github.com/gerefi/hellen154hyundai) are open source. For the majority of Hellen vehicle specific boards we only publish complete schematics while not publishing gerbers and BOMs.  

TL,DR: it' not that complicated:

Software: open

Platform: open

Wire-in boards: open

PnP: mostly not
