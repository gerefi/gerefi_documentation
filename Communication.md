My name is Andrey and I find face to face communication most effective. When face to face communication is not possible, I prefer voice calls sometimes with screen sharing.

I just find chatting wasteful and annoying for reasons which I am not able to articulate. Maybe stuff not important enough to be discussed over the phone should simply not be discussed at all.
