# gerEFI Android App

gerEFI Android App is part of [gerEFI Online](Online) suite. The primary job of gerEFI Android app is to provide gerEFI ECU with remote tuning capability.

One day we will publish gerEFI Android at the google store but for now you would have to install it using [gerEFI-release.apk](https://gerefi.com/build_server/gerEFI-release.apk)

You would have to agree installing application not from Play Store and you would probably have to disable Google Play Protect.

Q: How to disable "Google Play Protect"?

A: On Android >= 8
Settings => Apps => Google Play Store => Notifications => High priority => Turn OFF

On Android <= 7
Settings => Notifications => Google Play Store => Block all
